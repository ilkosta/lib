= pod should be unsafe

The `Pod` trait is currently used with `#[derive(Pod)]` and thus it doesn't make
much sense to mark it unsafe. However, simply deriving `Pod` on arbitrary types
is unsafe since it allows objects of that type to be filled with arbitrary
bytes.

`#[derive(Pod)]` should probably be replaced by `#[derive(unsafe_Pod)]` or the
derive should be removed completely so that people have to manually implement
it:

----
#[derive(Copy)]
struct T;

unsafe impl Pod for T { }
----
