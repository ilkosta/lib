= vmsplice cannot be used with immutable slices

`vmsplice(2)` is under-documented: The docs don't mention that `vmsplice` will
actually fill the provided pointers if the fd refers to the read-end of a slice.
Since there is no race-free way to detect whether a fd refers to a write-end or
a read-end of a slice, we cannot implement it with `&[u8]` arguments.

Currently `vmsplice` is not provided at all.
